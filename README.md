i just follow the free code camp instrction. i am able to complete without taking help of anyone but after finishing code its take time to understand the whole code. 
in html used normal tag & in css use normal properties except one -
 .class tag:not(.class) {
  }
  it is difficult for me to understand in once. till date it is not teach in class. when asked in class sir said we will lern this later. 
  please check what you are giving in assignment it is related to completed sylabus or not. plase don't give us the question out of sylabus in the starting.
